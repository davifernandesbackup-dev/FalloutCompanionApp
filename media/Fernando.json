When you craft or repair an item, you can optionally choose one of the required materials to randomize. The chosen material has its required amount decreased by your Luck modifier, to a minimum of 1, and it is replaced by a different, random material. Roll a 1d6 to determine the Rarity Tier of the chosen material, then another 1d6 to determine the material itself (rolling a 6 counts as a 5). See Crafting and Repair for the list of materials. Additionally, whenever you consume a food, drink, or chem, you can optionally choose to roll a Luck check with a DC of 15. If you succeed, the item gains an additional property from the Chem Properties table. Roll a d12 to determine the effect using the Chem Properties table, not counting Super Stimulant and Hyperstimulant. Additionally, whenever you buy or sell an item, you can optionally choose to randomly change the price of the item by rolling a d100, which determines the percentage to be applied to the base cost of the item. You can only do this once per item, and you cannot make any Barter skill checks or use your Discount ability to change the cost afterwards",
