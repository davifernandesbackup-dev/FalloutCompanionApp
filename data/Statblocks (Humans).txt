Statblocks (Humans)
Despite the mutations and hazards of the wasteland, humanity has persevered (though not all look human anymore, in the case of ghouls). Some wander the wastes alone, others band together in gangs and tribes, and others form large factions that control large swaths of territory.


Every human in this list has been featured in one way or another in a Fallout game. For Creature enemies, look in the Statblocks (Creatures) document.


These statblocks use items, mechanics, and rules from Fuse’s Fallout TTRPG Rewrite, linked below.

________________


Raiders
The scourges of the waste. Throw a dart at a map, you’ll probably land on some raider gang’s territory. As plentiful as they are disorganized, raiders are a chaotic bunch with no significant control structure. Above all, they take what they want and aren’t above doing so violently.
________________


Raider Scum
Medium Human, LVL 1
The lowest of any raider gang, Raider Scum are typically new recruits eager to prove their worth. Ill equipped and unprepared, they aren’t much of a threat on their own.
